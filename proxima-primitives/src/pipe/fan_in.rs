//! `FanIn<S, const N>` — sans-IO N→1 merge, itself a [`Pipe`]/[`UnpinPipe`].
//!
//! The fan-in counterpart to the fan-out family: N sources merged into one
//! item stream. Modeled as an explicit FSM because, unlike fan-out's
//! stateless `all`, a merge carries persistent cross-poll state — which
//! sources are still live, and a fairness cursor so one hot source cannot
//! starve the others.
//!
//! `FanIn` used to speak a bespoke protocol (`PollSource::poll_next(&mut
//! self, cx) -> Poll<Option<Item>>`) parallel to the pipe algebra. It now
//! IS a pipe: `Pipe::call(&self, ()) -> Result<S::Out, Exhausted>`. The
//! merged sources are `UnpinPipe<In = (), Err = Exhausted>` — a source
//! calls itself with nothing and produces an item, or resolves
//! [`Exhausted`] to say it will never produce again. Termination lives in
//! the `Err` channel instead of a second `Option`-shaped sentinel.
//!
//! TIER: this is the T0 floor — **no_std + no-alloc**. The sources live in a
//! `[S; N]` array (arity fixed at the type level), liveness is `[AtomicBool;
//! N]` (an atomic in place of `[bool; N]` because [`Pipe::call`] takes `&self`
//! — the merge's cross-poll state can no longer live behind `&mut self`), and
//! polling is `core::task`. No heap, no spawn, no channel — the kernel-bypass
//! merge shape (\*DK: merge N fixed NIC/NVMe queues with zero allocation), and
//! it tiers all the way down to bare metal.
//!
//! A runtime-arity no-alloc variant would back the sources with a
//! `heapless::Vec<S, CAP>` whose `CAP` is a build.rs/conflaguration sizing const
//! (the existing `RETRY_STATUS_CAP` pattern) — not built here; the const-`N`
//! form needs no build-time axis (the caller names the arity).
//!
//! `Item` (`S::Out`) is owned. The GAT lending form that makes the merge
//! zero-copy — the merged item borrowing into the producing source's ring
//! slot — is [`crate::pipe::drain_source::DrainFanIn`], a separate no_std
//! leaf built on the push-visitor model instead of this pull/`Pipe` one.
//!
//! ## Scan, don't race
//!
//! Each call to the merge's `call(())` future scans the live sources ONCE, in
//! [`Select`] order, and returns the first ready item. It does not drive `N`
//! sources concurrently and take a winner — that would be a `Race`/`Select`
//! combinator, a different (and heavier) primitive. A source whose `call(())`
//! is not yet ready is polled once, found `Pending`, and its in-flight future
//! is then DROPPED — the merge asks the source again (a fresh `call(())`) on
//! the next poll. This is why every merged source must be
//! [`proxima_core::markers::DropSafe`]: the source, not the transient call
//! future, is what registers the waker for "I have something now" — the call
//! future is disposable scaffolding around that registration, not the state
//! itself (see `proxima_core::signal::Fired` for the canonical shape: it
//! registers a waker slot with the level it observes and cleans the slot up
//! on `Drop`, so constructing a fresh one per scan is exactly as cheap and
//! correct as reusing one).
